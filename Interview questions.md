## Interview Questions & Answers

### 1. What makes a password strong?
A strong password has sufficient length (12+ characters), complexity (mixed character types), unpredictability (not based on common patterns), and is unique to each account.

### 2. What are common password attacks?
Brute force, dictionary attacks, hybrid attacks, rainbow table attacks, phishing, and social engineering.

### 3. Why is password length important?
Length exponentially increases the number of possible combinations, making brute force attacks computationally infeasible.

### 4. What is a dictionary attack?
An attack that uses pre-compiled lists of common passwords and words rather than trying every possible combination.

### 5. What is multi-factor authentication?
Using two or more verification factors: something you know (password), something you have (phone), something you are (biometrics).

### 6. How do password managers help?
They generate strong, unique passwords for each account, store them securely, and auto-fill them when needed.

### 7. What are passphrases?
Long passwords made of multiple random words, easier to remember but hard to crack due to length.

### 8. What are common mistakes in password creation?
Using short passwords, common patterns, personal information, and reusing passwords across multiple accounts.

## Conclusion

Password security requires a balance between complexity and memorability. The most effective approach is using long, complex passwords or passphrases managed through a password manager, combined with multi-factor authentication for critical accounts.
